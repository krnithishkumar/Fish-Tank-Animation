# Fish-Tank-Animation
Blender project on Fish Animation. Thanks to Vijay(IT) and Srinath(Mech) for contributing to this project

# Abstract
The animation of fish tank has been implemented using blender software that provides the resources for performing various 3D objects. The project focuses on developing the fish tank that looks more realistic as a glass. The texture of the tank is made using environmental mapping and a layer of realistic animation of water has been added to the tank. The fish model is performed by using 3D imaging and a fish image texture has been mapped on to the object for making the object appear more realistic. Then the rendering has been provided for creating the realistic animation of a fish tank. The light source has been mapped efficiently in such a way to render the animation with the most realistic view.
